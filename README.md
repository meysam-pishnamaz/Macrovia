# Macrovia

**Macrovia** is a personalized Android app that helps users monitor their daily intake of calories, protein, vitamins, and other essential nutrients. Users input personal data such as age, sex, height, weight, and goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance), and the app generates daily nutrition targets accordingly.

## Features

- 🧮 **Personalized Goals** — Calculates daily calorie and nutrient targets based on user profile.
- 🍽️ **Food Logging** — Add meals, snacks, and custom foods with nutrition details.
- 📊 **Progress Insights** — Compare intake vs. daily goals with real-time feedback.
- 🧠 **Smart Feedback** — Get alerts when you're under or over your nutritional targets.
